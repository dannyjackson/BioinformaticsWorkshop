# IV. Code Management with Github and VSCode 

While the process of coding can be messy, the end result needs to be legible and clear. I prefer to automate my scripts so that they can be used across projects by modifying a few parameters rather than manually revising the entire script. In this module, we will walk through code management using GitHub and VSCode, and will explore a few example scripts that can serve as templates for your future code.
