# III. Data Organization and Documentation

Taking your time and making your code clear, accessible, and organized can often feel like a misuse of time. We're goal-oriented people, and the goal is the product, not the process... what does it matter if my code is clean as long as I find the answer to my research question? We often code in a hyper-focused state with a "get it working" mindset that leaves little space for accurate documentation.

File naming conventions form the foundation for clear, effective, and organized code. They are essential for effective data management. Haphazard naming can lead to data misinterpretation or loss, and it's important to keep detailed descriptions of the naming conventions for a project that allows these files to be legible to someone else (in a metadata file, perhaps).

File Naming:
1.	Have you implemented a file naming convention for the raw files of project? If so, write it out in generalized terms (e.g. projectID_sampleID.fa.gz). Is it sufficient for future researchers to understand or do you need to make a change? If not, write out a generalized naming convention that you plan to use.
2.  Do you use file naming conventions for your downstream files? Look through some of the files that you've generated in the course of one of your projects. Are the file names meaningful? Can you readily reproduce these files from the raw files with your existing code? Can someone else?


Directory Structure:
3.	Open a new terminal window and access the HPC. On the page titled, “Current directory structure”, write out your directory structure using the example format. You do not need to write out the files, just the directories.
4.	If you are happy with your directory structure, skip this step. If you are not, go to the page titled, “Proper directory structure” and write out a more organized directory structure using the example format. You do not need to write out the files, just the directories.
